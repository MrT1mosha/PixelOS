üñ•Ô∏è PixelOS
Lightweight Windows Subsystem Built in Python

üöÄ About the Project
PixelOS is a modular Windows subsystem written in Python, designed to:

Extend Windows functionality through scripts and APIs.
Simplify task automation using Python.
Integrate third-party tools and Python libraries into Windows.
Ideal for developers, system administrators, and enthusiasts who want to create custom solutions for Windows.

‚ö° Features
Modularity: Add/remove components without restarting the core.
Python Integration: Full access to Python‚Äôs standard library and third-party packages (e.g., pywin32, psutil).
Automation: Create scripts to manage processes, files, networks, and other Windows resources.
Cross-Platform Compatibility: Works on Windows 10/11 and compatible with Linux (via WSL).
Windows API Access: Direct access to Windows APIs via Python (e.g., registry management, window control, driver interactions).
